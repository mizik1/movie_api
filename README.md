# movie_api

Project Description
The objective of this project was to build a server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
application provides users with access to information about different
movies, directors, and genres. Users can sign up and create a list of their favorite movies.

The biggest challenges I faced were learning the various components of this project - Express.js, SQL, MongoDB, Atlas (cloud-MongoDB), Heroku. Each one of these components has many features. Installing and running the required packages was also a learning experience. A lot of time was spent troubleshooting problems with the movie data that I created. The original data was restructured because it could not be imported into Atlas. Atlas expects newline JSON objects, not arrays so I installed a package called 'jq' then converted the JSON array to the proper format. This project was clearly more difficult than previous tasks due to the number of components used.

If I were to do this project again, I would ensure the data I created matched the formats Atlas accepts. Initially creating the database for SQL and then switching it to MongoDB was also a challenge. I learned that changing from one database format to another is challenging.
